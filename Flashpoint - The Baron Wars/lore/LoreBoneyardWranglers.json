    "Details" :"This scrappy bunch are the decendants of a famed scrapyard crew that returned discarded, broken and long forgotten warbirds of Terran 21st Centuary, like A8-272, to the skys.  Likewise, the same as 'Crew 5 & Dave' before them, they ferretted amongst the Tech graveyards across the Innersphere to return broken and long discarded 'Mechs to the battlefield. Their 'Mechs might look like they are held together with fencing wire and cocky poo - to your peril.",
