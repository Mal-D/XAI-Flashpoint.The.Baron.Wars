1.  MapRandomizer
2.  IRBTModUtils

The Baron Wars is optionally Dependant on 
1.  ColourfulFlashpoints
2.  IRBTModUtils
3.  MapRandomizer

##Notes on IRBTModUtils and MapRandomizer Mods.

A huge shout out to FrostRaptor for giving permission to package the above two MODs in this installation. The Settings.json and the Mod.json files within each Mod have already been altered to provide ONLY the functionality required by this flashpoint. Fiddling with these settings from what is in this installation - whilst using XAI - could result in you having performance issues. 

##Note on ColourFul FlashPoints Mod.

The author of this Mod has provided permission to bundle the Settings.json file ONLY. The Settings.json supplied has already been altered to provide the functionality required by this flashpoint. The Mod itself will need to be sourced from 
https://github.com/wmtorode/ColourfulFlashPoints  (Currently at time of writing is Version 1.1.0)

Install ColourFul FlashPoints Mod and replace the Settings.json file in the mod with the one in the Flashpoint installation Archive

Although these three Mods are listed in the Mod.json file as 'optional' the Mod has been tested without these Mods installed but the game immersion suffers somewhat. 

### ModTek versions 4.1.0.0 and up
The current installation has been successfully tested on 4.1.1.0.

# Install 
If your XAI Installation conforms with the information above the installation is as simple as extracting the contects of the Archive into your /Mods folder. (GoG Battletech installations will be in a different Directory.)

### Steam Installation
[your game installation drive]/Steam/Steamapps/Common/Battletech/Mods directory.     
Open the Archive and copy the folders in the archive file into the /Mods Directory. The folders contain only files to support the Flashpoint and the Flashpoint itself. If you are asked to replace files PLEASE SAY YES!

### GOG Install
You should have a link on your desktop to start the game, if you right click it and go to Properties you should be able to click "Open File Location" button in the "Shortcut" tab of the window that opens up. This should bring you to the game folder, create the Mods folder and then install the mods in the Mods Directory you have just created. See above. 

7Zip Archives can be opened in WinRar and later versions of WinZip.
