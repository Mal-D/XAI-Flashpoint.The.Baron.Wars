# Please now READ THIS

The Support Bot for this patch, will ask you for the code word.

This patch re-adds the MapRandomizer MOD - with the gracious permission from the authors @FrostRaptor and T-Bone - The Mod itself doesn't add any player functionality however, it does add significant elements that allow Flashpoint actions that are not normally available and provide for a more immersive game play.

The Mod in particular is  

    MapRandomiser Version: 1.2.0.3

The Mod has been supplied in this Flashpoint but has been disabled. Supplying it in this state is necessary to prevent a "Map not Found" error and softlocking the game while in Story Mode.

# 1.    Players in Story Campaign Mode

If you are planning playing the Kaema Story Campaign - Use the MODS button on the bottom Left of the Main Screen.

See the image 1.MapRandomizerSetup in this installation folder.
 
Scroll through the list of Mods and make sure there is a 'disabled' Mod called MapRandomizer.

See Image 2.MapRandomizerSetup in this installation folder - this is normal and you don't need to do any further actions.

### When you have completed the Story Campaign

When you have finished the Story Campaign and you are planning to play the Open Career Mode - Again use the MODS button on the bottom Left of the Main start up game Screen (image 1.MapRandomizerSetup).

## 3.    Other important information

### ColourfulFlashPoints Mod

While we supply the folder and settings for this mod but you will have to download ColourfulFlashPoints Mod from the Author from the following location.

    https://github.com/wmtorode/ColourfulFlashPoints

Just replace the original settings file with the one in the folder to see all the XAI Flashpoints appear in all their glory.

### WarTech IIc 

This Mod will colour and sort your Missions in the Contracts screen and unfortunately it puts Flashpoint Missions at the bottom of the list. We are working on re-ordering these so the Flashpoint Mission are given top Priority.

Code word is 'Enlightened' we will ask you for this code word to know that you have not just skipped to the bottom.
